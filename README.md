# Sentiment_Analysis_On_Twitter_Data
In this repository, we will analyse the sentiment - racist, non-racist - based on the tweet or comment. Sentiment analysis is one of the many applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP). We'll be using python to develop a model which can classify the tweet into sexist/racist and non-racist tweet.
